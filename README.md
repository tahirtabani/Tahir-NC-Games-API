If this repo is pulled, you will need to add the environment varibles in manually.

This can be done by creating: .env.test - inside the file: PGDATABASE=nc_games_test .env.development - inside the file: PGDATABASE=nc_games

This will ensure you are connecting to the correct database and be done via the script in the JSON file: "setup-dbs": "psql -f ./db/setup.sql"

Running this in the terminal will set everything up.
